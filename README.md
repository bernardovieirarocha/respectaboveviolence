# Cyberbullying Awareness NGO Project

This GitHub repository hosts a former school English project centered around the conceptualization of a non-governmental organization (NGO) dedicated to combating cyberbullying. Developed in 2021, the project includes a variety of educational materials aimed at raising awareness about the detrimental impacts of cyberbullying on individuals and communities.

## Key components of this repository include:

    Animation Video: An engaging and informative animation video illustrating the various effects of cyberbullying, designed to educate viewers about the importance of fostering a safe and respectful online environment.
    Fake History Documentation: Detailed documentation outlining the fictitious history and mission of the NGO, providing context for the project's objectives and initiatives.
